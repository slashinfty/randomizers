# JSON Format
The list of randomizers is formatted in the following way:

```
{
    "name": "game name (randomizer name)",
    "system": "capitalized console name, like NES or GBA",
    "url": "link to randomizer",
    "source": "link to source code, if available",
    "note": "additional information about the randomizer, if necessary",
    "platform": "windows, multi, or online",
    "old": true or false, if it is depreciated
}
```

You can always examine the JSON for examples.

Form submissions for randomizers can be found on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EMWAgScrHZv9mZuPpmXAIGiswQ_p5K0FuMxa1c6nJCM/edit?usp=sharing).
